Incubaid is a Belgian-based company. We are proud to be based in a neutral country, while doing successful international business.

Our current active project which takes +90% of our time is <a href="http://www.greenitglobe.com" target="_blank">Green IT Globe</a>.

The success behind our incubator is based on following principles:

* Independence - we keep our portfolio companies 100% indepedent, early-stage or late-stage, during the complete lifecycle
* Invention - invention has be disruptive, and not promising incremental added-value. We only work with the best inventors
* International - the world has been globalized since decades, our teams are working from all continents doing deals

* Employment - enabling technology to be deployed locally, creating jobs and opportunities
