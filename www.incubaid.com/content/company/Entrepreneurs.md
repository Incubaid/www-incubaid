### Entrepreneurs

Incubaid has opportunities for both investors and entrepreneurs.

We focus on high-tech ventures that satisfy clear market needs with a sustainable competitive advantage based on solid intellectual property.

Incubaid takes an active approach in growing the ventures within its portfolio:

### Bridge the Funding Gap

Early-stage funding has almost ceased to exist in most regions of Europe.

Many existing funds have stopped investing indefinitely or have moved up the value chain.

VC funds have grown so large in recent years that they cannot afford to invest small amounts in a given deal and risk having an unmanageable portfolio.

Incubaid still strongly believe that there are a significant number of potential blockbuster start-ups out there that are not getting the funding they need just because they are “a little too early” in the process.

### Fill the Experience Gap

European start-ups in the nineties suffered from a critical lack of start-up and management experience.

Today, start-ups can tap into a growing pool of management executives with the necessary track record of managing high-growth start-ups.

However, building a high level management team during the early stages of a company is expensive and time-consuming.

Compared to the US, the lack of technology start-up expertise is still considered to be the most significant obstacle stopping Europe from building more truly successful technology companies.

Incubaid aims to fill this gap by putting managing partners, with significant operational experience, within the organisation at various stages of a technology start-up.

We are actively involved in addressing a wide variety of start-up specific challenges:

-   Entrepreneurs are big on technology but short on marketing. This attitude is based on a common belief amongst entrepreneurs that a good product sells itself.
-   Management ignores the importance of clearly defined product positioning, target customers and value proposition. They initiate sales from a technology perspective and prefer feature-selling over selling customer benefits.
-   European companies have been traditionally strong in technology services but are not familiar with the specifics and challenges of growing true product companies. They often combine services and products resulting in a critical lack of product definition.
-   Start-ups have little experience with business plans and go-to-market strategies. The usual result is long documents that focus on technology details and extensive financial modelling. Pitching investment opportunities to VCs is not given proper priority and is, more often than not, just plain unprofessional.
-   Growth companies do not pay proper attention to competition. Because they are too inward looking, and addicted to technology, they fail to correctly position their product. There is a need to show their customers the advantages of their product, and why it is the best solution. They also miss out on the importance of technology and marketing partnerships. Not to mention their inadequate responses to major industry shifts and trends.
