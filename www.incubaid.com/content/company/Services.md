### Services

-   Skilled Management Team: The Incubaid team provides a unique set of strategic, technological, operational, legal and financial skills.
-   Track Record: We have successfully survived two major downturns over the last 10 years while still delivering very attractive returns to our investors.
-   Venture Partner Program: A select group of prominent technology entrepreneurs and executives will be active as coach and co-investors, using their networks to source deals, screen start-ups, help companies grow and search for exits.
-   Operational and hands-on: We accept only between one and three new companies per year. This way our operational expertise is put to good use.
-   International Network: We have an extensive international network of high-level business connections to be leveraged, including Venture Partners in the US, India, France and Germany.
-   Significant Management Commitment: We are a motivated and cohesive management team that is not burdened by succession issues or historical portfolio overhang.
