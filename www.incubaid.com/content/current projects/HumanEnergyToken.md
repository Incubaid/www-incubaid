### Human Energy Token



##### Founded in 2016

Human Energy Token is a concept initiative launched by Incubaid in order to define a green, non-speculative blockchain currency different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a power-hungry currency - mining of 1 bitcoin consumes more than 300 pounds of fossil fuel.

##### Why Human Energy Token?

The world is more and more driven by greed, war and consumption which leads to more and more pollution and poverty.

The Human Energy Token.org project is driven by people with ambition to do good and use the latest innovations and technology to create a safe and stable currency.

The Human Energy Token goal

* inflation proof currency
* a safe payment system globally usable
* not used for criminal activities
* GREEN: no mining required
* no speculation: the value of the coin cannot be manipulated by buying or selling more
* super easy to use (also by non IT capable users)

Human Energy Token's will be used for social responsible projects in emerging markets

Feel free to join our Human Energy Token movement as stakeholder, shareholder, project investor, or simply because you care.
