### Introduction

Incubaid aims to accelerate the successful development of technology ventures. Historically, the focus of the company has been around datacenter automation. More recently, through a number of successful ventures, the focus has shifted to cloud computing and green datacenters of which automation is still an important aspect of this strategy.

Around 2005, Amazon took the lead in the cloud computing industry with its S3 and EC2 services. Google (AppEngine) and Salesforce (Force.com) have also become prominent players in the sector. The ecosystem has segmented into Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS) and Software as a Service (SAAS). Cloud computing is experiencing a growing popularity across all industry segments, with a lot of activity within the top layer. Incubaid has identified many opportunities for innovation in the IAAS layer.

In spite of all the innovation in the cloud over the past few years, the IAAS layer still faces a lot of issues especially around its Green credentials:

-   Power consumption is still at unacceptably high levels; over a period of of 3 years, the cost of power has jumped to 50% of hardware costs.
-   There are still too many manual processes; we still have not reached the full automated solution as promised by the cloud paradigm.
-   Current storage technologies fail to offer a low cost, always online, and unbreakable system and are not adequate for cloud storage requirements
-   The levels of complexity in the datacenter has not been reduced; most cloud platforms do nothing more than virtualise servers.

Incubaid creates and stimulates companies that help to solve many of these issues.
