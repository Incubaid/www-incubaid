### Powering Green IT Globe

Our experience as technology enterpreneurs has led us to found Incubaid. Since 2000 we have been exiting a number of startups to technology giants. These giants, such as Oracle, Verizon, Hitachi Data Systems, have established billion dollar revenue streams in datacenter storage and cloud services, using technology, products and companies originally started by Incubaid.

Throughout the years we gathered capital, technology, financial and legal advisory, and a network of very experienced and international startup veterans that support a portfolio of early-stage startups and our main holding company, Green IT Globe. Incubaid is unique as it has been carefully been protecting and growing the intelectual property while generating serious returns to its investors.

Besides Green IT Globe, the areas of incubation and innovation are centered around blockchain innovation, new digital currencies, next generation mobile applications and the decentralization of the Internet, making it much more green, friendly towards privacy and enabling new digital economies to realize its full potential using internet platforms provided by Green IT Globe and Incubaid.
