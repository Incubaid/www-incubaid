### Powering Green IT Globe

Our experience as technology enterpreneurs has led us to found Incubaid. Since 2000 we have been exiting a number of startups to superior technology giants. Companies such as Oracle, Verizon, Hitachi Data Systems, have established billion dollar revenue streams in datacenter, storage and cloud services, using technology, products and companies that were originally started by Incubaid.

Throughout the years we gathered capital, financial and legal advisory, disruptive technology and a network of very experienced and international startup veterans that support a portfolio of early-stage startups and our largest portfolio company, Green IT Globe.
