##### Founded in 2016

Bettercoin is a technology initiative launched by Incubaid and a group of 50 people in order to define a green, non-speculative blockchain currency different than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a power-hungry currency - mining of 1 bitcoin consumes more than 300 pounds of fossil fuel.

##### Currency Design

The objective for bettercoin is to provide society with a safe and stable digital currency:

-   Powered by blockchain distributed ledger technology: rivine.io
-   Powered by mobile-only peer-to-peer payment technology: rogerthat
-   Speculation-free, backed by real assets and social responsible projects
-   Secure identification and privacy regulated by Itsyou.online
-   Community driven financial institution without central command

##### Why Bettercoin?

The world is more and more driven by greed, war and consumption which leads to more and more pollution and poverty. The Bettercoin.org project is driven by people with ambition to do good and use the latest innovations and technology to create a safe and stabel currency.  

-   Investment in green and eco-friendy digital economies 
-   Investment in social responsible projects in emerging markets
-   Investment in a more scalable and privacy-protected democratic Internet
-   Investment in delivering low-cost low-energy consuming mobile connectivity
