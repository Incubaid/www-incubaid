##### Founded in 2009

Racktivity launched in 2009 with the ambition to make datacenters eco-friendly and green. Datacenters are globally massive consumers of electricity. Millions of servers are running without knowledge or insights in efficiency and power utilization. Racktivity has a portfolio of energy management systems for datacenter racks and individual servers, in which the uptime of the servers can also be remotely managed.

Green IT Globe has done a 100% acquisition of Racktivity:

-   Energy management technology and intelectual property is controlled by GIG 
-   Product roadmap and new innovations are integrated with Green IT Globe
-   All staff and developers now for for Green IT Globe in Belgium
-   Customers and resellers are managed by Green IT Globe
-   Racktivity brand is 100% owned by Green IT Globe

##### Why Green IT Globe?

In 2016 Green IT Globe acquired the assets of Racktivity. The integration of the Racktivity energy management stack into the IT generators makes it possible to run internet datacenters in very remote locations across the world, in which electricity is scarce and brownouts are daily reality.

##### Product Design

Racktivity has created the industryâ€™s first and only complete system for energy management within the data center. Racktivity was formed with the aim of helping customers understand and control energy distribution in near real-time across the enterprise. With this enhanced visibility, organisations can better align IT business operations with their true cost. Racktivity provides extreme granularity to our customers across their entire enterprise, across structures, sites and geographies.
