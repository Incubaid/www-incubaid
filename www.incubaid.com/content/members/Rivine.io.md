### Rivine.io Blockchain Reinvented

##### Founded in 2016

[Green IT Globe](http://www.greenitglobe.com) is not only leading the IT as Energy evolution, but is also pushing the boundaries of the current blockchain technology into new orbits. Incubaid and Green IT Globe have started Rivine.io, a technology-led private blockchain alternative to having a fully public and uncontrolled network and state machine secured by cryptoeconomics (eg. proof of work, proof of stake). With Rivine.io it is also possible to have a blockchain technology framework where access permissions are regulated by the [Itsyou.online](http://www.itsyou.online) user, with rights to modify or even read the blockchain state restricted to a new public-private voting mechanism, while still maintaining many kinds of partial guarantees of authenticity and decentralization that blockchains provide. 

##### Product Design

Rivine.io is driving a service model on top of new blockchain models. Rivine.io and [Green IT Globe](http://www.greenitglobe.com) can provision the ultimate compute power to keep the private blockchain growing and secured, while users can execute more and more secure transactions. Using the mobile application framework of [Rogerthat](http://www.rogerthat.net) you can enable mobile users to define business processes directly on their private blockchain. This has tremendous value to the end-user in terms of privacy and secure execution of transaction, without having a service provider acting as middleman.  

##### Why Rivine.io?

At Incubaid we believe a public blockchain model is not scalable, nor usable:

-   transactions and business processes should not need to become visible or transparent
-   mining of the distributed ledger becomes a very polluting business, example bitcoin
-   blockchain implementations should not be overly complex and have to be simplified
-   mining should be done by green companies, providing low-energy compute capacity

#### Technology

Our ultimate goal is to become a platform-as-a-service partner to many businesses that want to benefit from green and private blockchain

-   Itsyou.online identity management
-   Rogerthat enterprise mobility 
-   Bettercoin virtual currency
