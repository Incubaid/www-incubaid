##### Activities:

More and more people are using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets every day. Companies are rolling out more mobile services and custom web apps for staff and customers. New devices, services and applications are now core to the market proposition as the web becomes more mobile each day.

As part of this evolution, Application to Person communication or A2P is critical as it lets you streamline communication processes using realtime interactive messages with your customers, partners, employees, users or any kind of subscribers.

Today's A2P market is largely unstructured. Each company still has to develop and deploy its own custom web or mobile app frontend.

Rogerthat offers a much cheaper way to enables a real time, bidrectional and interactive spam free relation channel between services of companies and their customers. Disruptive technology was required to allow always on & responsive communication with the mobile devices.

-   Organizations who want to automate business processes by including human interaction or notification steps
-   Customer service organizations and helpdesks who want to enhance their IVR systems with smartphone-based self-service tools
