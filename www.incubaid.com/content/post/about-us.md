# About us

Open vStorage has been developed by a team with a proven track record in datacenters and cloud computing. The team offers a counterpoint to the hype surrounding cloud computing by advocating that organisations need to challenge the existing best of breed technologies.

Together, this tight knit group has spent the last decade focusing on datacenter and utility computing with the aim of bringing customers truly green, highly available and agile IT platforms. To reach this goal, the team has set about redesigning many of the vital parts of the IT ecosystem for the cloud capable datacenter environment.

With Open vStorage we have created the most scalable & high performance & reliable Software Defined Storage layer which can be used as foundation for any cloud platform.

### Target Market:
* IT Channel Partners selling to SME & Enterprise
* Service & Cloud Providers
* Enterprise storage optimized for the performance required to efficiently run a highly scalable number of virtual machines with IO comparable to traditional SAN vendors.
* Europe, US and Middle East.
