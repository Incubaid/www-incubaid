##### Founded:

2007

##### Exit:

-   Acquired by SUN Microsystems (now Oracle) in 2009
-   More than 3x return in 2 years for investors

##### Activities:

-   First company in the world with ground-breaking cloud computing automation software.
-   When acquired, Q-layer had committed revenue from customers in excess of $6.5 million
-   Q-layer was the last acquisition in the history of SUN Microsystems.

##### Today:

-   SUN Microsystems acquired Q-layer to be the foundation of their new cloud strategy. This was a very strategic acquisition for them.
-   We became responsible for their cloud strategy globally. Their cloud strategy was seen as last change for SUN to reinvent itself.
-   At this point it is not clear what Oracle will do with the Q-layer technology.
